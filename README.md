# Matt’s dotfiles (from Mathias and Paul Irish) adapted for ZSH

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/Projects/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattstauffer/ohmyzsh-dotfiles.git
```

The bootstrap.sh file currently doesn't work, so just copy any of the dotfiles you like into your home directory.

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/mattstauffer/ohmyzsh-dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
brew bundle .brewfile
```
